# NJ Builds

This is a learning project, its objective is to explore the [Catala](https://catala-lang.org/en/) programming language.

Two provisions from Chapter 10 of the 2021 Internaitonal Residential Code New Jersey Edition have been selected to attempt to create an implementation in Catala. The purpose of the legislative code is to outline "requirements for the construction, seismic reinforcing and achorage of masonry chimney and fireplaces." The building code can be examined [here](https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/NJRC2021P1/chapter-10-chimneys-and-fireplaces#NJRC2021P1_Pt03_Ch10_SecR1001.5). 

As I work on this project, I will record my thoughts in the `journal` directory. There is no fixed endpoint for this project, because its objective is personal learning it "ends" when it has equipped me with a functional understanding of Catala.

Legislative excerpt can be found in `2021_ICC_Residential_NJ.txt`
